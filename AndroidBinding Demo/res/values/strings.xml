<string name="explaination">
This is a demonstration to a new programming framework for Android, which is named Android binding.
Application can develop using the MVVM pattern, which stands for Model-View-ViewModel. \n\n

In this current build, all the presentation and model binding are declared in the Layout (XML) file. 
Model is provided in a different object. You can see in the Activity file that there is no more complex 
logic about how user interaction is to be handled. \n\n

This project is currently under development, 
and it is not stable enough to give an official release. 
If you are interested in this, please pay a visit to the 
Project homepage which is situated at: https://code.google.com/p/android-binding/ \n\n

This project is initiated and developed by Andy Tsui (gueei.com@gmail.com). If you are interested in helping 
the development, please send me an email. \n\n
